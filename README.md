#  PyTorch NLP Projects â€“ Question Answering System

Welcome to my PyTorch-based repository where Iâ€™ve explored key deep learning concepts and implemented a **simple Question Answering (QA) System** using pretrained models.

This repo is ideal for beginners wanting to get started with **PyTorch**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **transformers**.

##  Topics Covered

###  PyTorch Fundamentals
- Tensors & operations
- Autograd and backpropagation
- Model building using `nn.Module`
- Optimizers (`SGD`, `Adam`)
- Loss functions (CrossEntropy, MSE)
- GPU/CPU training

### âœ… Neural Network Architectures
- Feedforward Networks
- RNN / LSTM basics
- Word embeddings
- Custom datasets and dataloaders

###  NLP with PyTorch
- Tokenization and preprocessing
- Sequence classification
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Transformers (using Hugging Face)

##  Final Project: Simple Question Answering System

###  Description
A basic **Question Answering system** built using Hugging Faceâ€™s pretrained `bert-base-uncased` model. Given a passage and a question, it returns the most probable answer from the passage.

###  Tools Used
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- `torch`, `torchvision`, `transformers`
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

##  Example

**Input Passage**:
> "PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and NLP."

**Question**:
> What is PyTorch used for?

**Answer**:
> computer vision and NLP
